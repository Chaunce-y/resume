Hi!! My name is Chauncey Daniels. I am a Software Engineer-in-training at General Assembly. I've created an NPM package that you can download and install to view my npm resume! The command to install  is ```npm i @12se7en/resu-me```, and to run is ```resu-me```. Enjoy and be sure to follow to join me on my Software Engineering journey!
